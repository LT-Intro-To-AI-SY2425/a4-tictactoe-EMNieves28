# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Honestly, the most difficult part of tic-tac-toe was the syntax errors throughout the whole code. Look me a little longer than usual to finish.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer to the game by maybe creating a bot that understands the game and how to make legal moves.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I might get the computer to play the best move every time by programing a bunch of games that they could go off of and know how where to play their X or O to have their best chances of winning.
